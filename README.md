# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

My name is Haiyi Sun, and my pronouns are she/her. My current favorite game is Black Myth Wukong. I also enjoy playing Valorant and Tetris. I don't have any prior experience with game development. I'm hoping to start out with simple games like platformer or a text based storygame with minimal visuals.

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [ X ] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?

I'm hoping to get experience working on an actual game. I'd like to get better at the coding aspect of game making and I want to know more about building UIs.
 
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?

I'm nervous about coding because I'm still relatively new to coding.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.
